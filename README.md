#### Typescript
If you're interested in a type supported version of the game checkout the `typescript` branch and follow the instructions from there.


# Cmds to Run

Install npm dependencies 

```
npm install --yes
```

Run eslint on script.js

```
npm run lint
```

Generate eslint HTML report (on report.html)
Note: Keep report filters in 'All', as the others have a bug

```
npm run report 
```

For convinience, install the eslint VS Code extension, as errors/warnings will come up automatically.
